##### 31/8/19  
  
Itâ€™s hard to imagine the heat in winter    
And every time it rains    
It seems as if it will never stop    
And when the sun burns us again    
The memories of the rain fade quickly      
  
##### 3/8/19  
  
Are we drifting so aimlessly  
Without a brother or friend at all  
In a vast infinity  
Forsaken by god  
And the devil alike   
  
##### 25/7/19  
Rubbish start   
She is forgetting to hear oceans  
Foamy tea calling  
Violent. Her desire   
And forgetting faith  
She fell   
Effervescing into nothing
