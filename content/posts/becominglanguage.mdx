Ko wai au?   
I don’t know.   
I live  
I breathe   
He pai ki ahau  
  
Wo mingzi shemme?  
Wo jiao Jessica   
I drink  
I fall  
Ni kan wo ma?  
  
Ji ge shuo bu shi wo de!  
It’s not mine  
But if its in my mind  
Does it belong to me?  
  
And If I carry it to my death eventually  
And it’s laid beside when I am buried  
And we rot together  
Maybe what grows in that place  
is something better?  
  
Ich weiss es nicht  
Wo ich herkomme  
  
And I also don’t know  
Where I am going  
Or in fact  
Anything else at all  
  
But I do have a question  
If I continue my consumption  
Of the land that I walk on  
Can one become  
Another one?  
  
I live   
I walk  
I breathe  
I absorb  
I change  
  
Change my tongue  
Change my name  
  
If I understand  
Can I control  
I know  
I dont know  
Who am I?  
Chan mai khao jai
