It’s quite amazing  
This word “bitch”  
Truly a testament  
To the English language  
  
It’s rather impressive  
Just How versatile   
A word can be  
Depending on the context  
  
Take for example   
The female dog   
If you care enough to   
Tell the difference   
  
Pretty harmless  
You might think  
For an animal  
That doesn’t understand   
  
And that is bred  
And fed  
And fought for sport  
And whose only real value   
Is making more dogs   
  
Who are bred  
And fed  
And fought for sport   
  
Now imagine, if you can  
A female human  
Usually held in higher regard  
Than a dog  
  
Yet when you’re upset   
Use this word  
To Knock her down a level  
And call her bitch  
  
Suddenly   
She’s under The control of the man  
He keeps her and in return   
She entertains  
  
She’s a burden  
To a point   
You feed her and breed her   
And she’s useful, if you keep her trained up well  
  
Now consider, if you will  
The greatest animal of all  
It’s the man  
That goes without saying   
  
If you want to knock him down   
What better way  
Than to allude   
That he is like a woman  
  
He better Be aware   
of being that bitch  
If you don’t do your job   
They’ll do away with you  
And Don’t waste time   
Talking shit   
Like emotions,   
Unless you wanna be knocked down a peg or two  
  
I’m under the impression   
That I’m under the thumb  
Because of words like this one   
And under me?  
  
Anyone I choose to label As my bitch  
they become  
the rung  
I step on  
To elevate myself
