##### 31/8/19  
  
It’s hard to imagine the heat in winter    
And every time it rains    
It seems as if it will never stop    
And when the sun burns us again    
The memories of the rain fade quickly      
  
##### 3/8/19  
  
Are we drifting so aimlessly  
Without a brother or friend at all  
In a vast infinity  
Forsaken by god  
And the devil alike   
  
##### 25/7/19  
Rubbish start   
She is forgetting to hear oceans  
Foamy tea calling  
Violent. Her desire   
And forgetting faith  
She fell   
Effervescing into nothing   
  
##### 26/7/19  
  
The sky is green  
Turtles reign supreme  
I’ve got a magic bean  
Grows a plant that’s nasty and mean  
  
But though it shouts cuss words obscene  
It hides behind a smokey screen  
Hiding putrid leaves uncleaned  
And all is not what it seemed   
  
Something sparkles in the fog  
A tiny diamond encrusted frog   
Sitting on the belly of a bog rolling hog  
That loves best our poison plant’s smelly sloppy slog  
Making mud and grime from dirt and fallen logs  
  
##### 27/7/19  
  
Slow down, she said   
Waving  
Her lovely hands  
Caress my face  
Tell me which is more powerful  
The push or the pull
