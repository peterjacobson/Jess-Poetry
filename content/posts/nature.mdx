The ocean makes a skeleton of everything  
The coral  
The tree  
Even the mammal  
Even me  
  
The ship  
Wrecked  
The singular shoe  
The dirt  
THe sand  
The sky  
And Even You  
  
And the ocean can make gemstones   
From sand  
And beer bottles  
Little bits of shell  
  
And the man can make land  
Into a barren hell  
  
The earth makes fools of us all  
And Just as well  
  
Because we are  
  
Believing we can believe in God and ourselves  
God laughs in our faces  
And sends plagues to diminish our races  
Into dust  
All while smirking at us  
  
Whilst moving the earth beneath us  
The soil  
The wave  
Even the oil  
Even the grave  
  
Nothing is holy  
Nothing is sacred  
Nothing you care about matters  
  
Maybe youâ€™ll remember that when   
Papatuanuku sticks her foot into your house  
And everything shatters
