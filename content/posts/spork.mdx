I am a teetering precipice  
Of indistinguishableness  
I straddle the precarious  
Pointed and posed to penetrate  
My inclination to choose a side  
A narrow void of 11 thousand miles  
Full of crispy chips and chooky chicks  
And togs and tinnies  
With no dictionary  
  
How tiresome the plight  
The dyad  
A double entendre that is lost on both sides  
The red rag in a bull fight  
The twilight   
Of neither day nor night  
  
Sarcasm so stoic that it comes all the way around  
To sincerity again  
I am a false friend  
I am the Prego  
The Rathaus  
The perpetually misunderstood  
Speaking two languages   
but only half as well as i should  
  
I am a spork  
Noone knows which compartment i should be  
In the cutlery draw  
whilst having  
Seemingly advantageous attributes  
Of both the fork  
And the spoon  
Actually just a novelty   
Twice as useless as either of the originals  
By themselves would be  
  
With a vague inexplicable charm  
A curious monstrosity   
Equal shares of intrigue   
and pity  
Requires a second glance  
and given a chance  
In that it is always chosen last  
And only when  
All the good forks  
Are in the wash  
  
I am purple  
In that I am neither blue nor red  
But have been made from both  
A brownish purple  
With hints of green and yellow  
The imminent outcome on the pallet of every child  
Who is wild  
Uninformed and misguided  
Not sure how to achieve   
What they haven't yet decided  
  
A hazy horizon between land  
And sea  
In that you can discern me  
But only vaguely  
  
How unburdened I would be  
To throw off the shackles  
of boundary  
  
And choose my own name  
But instead  
I am a spork
